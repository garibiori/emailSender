# Code Review

* Project name:Email
* Developer:Ori Garibi and Ofek Shoichet 
* Code Reviewer: Marisa Mini

On a scale of 0 to 5, I give this code a rating of _5___ based on the following criteria:

0.  The developer did not do the assignment, or did not give me access to their repo.

* Specifically:

1.  The program has syntax errors and does not compile

* Specifically:

2.  The program compiles successfully but generates runtime errors

* Specifically:

3.  The program compiles and runs but does not perform correctly and does not produce correct results.

* Specifically:

4.  The program compiles and produces correct output but does not follow assignment specifications, is insufficiently documented or does not pass checkstyle audit.

* Specifically:

5.  The program produces correct output, is well written, passes checkstyle audit, is well documented and complies with all the Chapman Computer Science Coding Standards.  The repository includes an appropriate README.md file and the documentation at the beginning of the program has been edited to describe the program and not the assignment.  

* Suggestions for improving the code: No, the code runs well, I like that you added comments to let us know what the code was doing.
